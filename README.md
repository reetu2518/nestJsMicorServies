# nestJsMicorServies
##	In Nest, a microservice is fundamentally an application that uses a different transport layer than HTTP.
##	Nest supports several built-in transport layer implementations, called transporters, which are responsible for transmitting messages between different microservice instances. Microservices use the TCP transport layer by default.
##	RabbitMQ is an open-source and lightweight message broker which supports multiple messaging protocols.
